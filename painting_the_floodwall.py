    Calculate the maximum total length of the fence that can be painted
    without allowing any two artists' work to overlap.

    Recursive formula:
    Let C(A) denote the maximum total length of the fence
    that can be painted using murals in array A that don't overlap.
    
    Then C(A) = max(A[0][1] - A[0][0] + C(B), C(A \ A[0]),
    where B = array of murals that don't overlap with A[0]

    :param: {int} starting position
    :param: {int} ending position
    :return: {int} maximum total length of the fence
